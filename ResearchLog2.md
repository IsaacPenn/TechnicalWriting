# Technical Writing - Research Log 2

Looking into Zines, I've found that they were first in use around the 1920s when people wanted to share their passion about science fiction literature. This slowly evolved over the years to become the first choice of many of those looking to self publish their work in a small magazine-like form. Their distinct focus on art and drawing coupled with writings on topics that range from helping abuse victims to comic books is unparalled by any other form of media. People have come to use Zines primarialy from the creative freedom they provide. Because it is the artist alone who is typically publishing these Zines, they often turn out as social commentary with no filter. This kind of commentary is what named the Punk genre through a Zine named "Punk" by Legs McNiel as well as moved the Third-Wave Femenist movement in the 80s. 

You can learn a lot about the society of the time by looking at Zines. They were typically very honest about who they are appealing to or targeted for. The writer knew what they wanted to say and they said it loud and proud to their fellow peers and/or community. 

While Zines are said to not have rules in how to make them, they do have conventional styles. They are heavily artistic. Drawn art is everywhere and typically on every page. Zines are mostly used for activism movements or are opinion pieces or even similiar to help books. 

In making my own Zine, we decided to make it about Zines themselves. It's a straight forward answer to how we wanted to include the History and freedom of Zines while also making one as a demonstration. Since our audience is going to be a College 101 English class we want to make the Zine accessible and easy to follow, but fun too. Zines are fun and expressive in their nature so the hope is not to make a boring tutorial. 

My partner and I dicussed how to go about sizing and putting the pages together for a while. If we wanted the papers to be easily connected we could have put the Zine all on one page that folded up into a Zine, but I thought that be to much work to resize and too small to fit all the information that we wanted to. So we decided on going with simple half folded papers stapled together in the middle so that we could fit everything with bigger text that's easier to read. But Zines are inherently inaccessablie to some right? Yes, but maybe with bigger text those who struggle to see or read will have at least a little bit of an easier time. That's my hope at least.
