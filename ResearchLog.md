#Technical Writing - Research Log

Week 2 - My initial thoughts and understanding of technical writing was not much of anything. I believed that such writing
was for manuels and instructions, but now I see that it is like a bridge between those who are experts in their field to those
who are average people curious about the subject.

As for the Lego Instruction Set, I believe that I could have done a better job really only if I could have worked around 
Microsoft Word's programming a little better to adjust the placement of the pictures in my set of instructions. Otherwise, the 
usablility tests went rather well. There were unique interptations of my build, but with the pictures it was hard to deviate 
from the given example too drastically.

The *reasoning* behind my decision to include large, easy pictures that one could follow and the incorpuration of using more
wordy instructions was most certainly based on the percieved audience I thought I would have following my instructions. 
Because we are in a college class I believed that the inclusion of written instruction might be more helpful for those who
wanted to make sure that their build was as close to correct as possible, but added pictures for those who are more visual
learners, or for thsoe that did not see the need to use the written instructions ar all. 

I chose to use Google Docs for the delivery of my Lego instructions because of the more leanient movement of images in the 
document. Google Docs is also connected to Google Drive which is one of the most convenient way to share documents. Even if
the teacher did not ask that we use Google Drive to share our documents I knew that it would be easiest to share the Google Doc over the internet.

When first using GitHub it was very easy to use and set up my repository. The email verification code was a little annoying to be honest though. If I ever feel the need to learn and use coding I can easily see myself using this site before any other. From GitHub's own tutorial, I think I'd like to improve my use of space and the positioning of my pictures to look more like theirs. It was clean and straightforward.

What I have learned this week is that Microsoft Word documents do not convert cleanly into Google Doc documents, and therefore it would be good to keep in mind what kind of document is being asked to be used in the final product before commiting to a specific program.
