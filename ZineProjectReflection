# Technical Writing Zine Personal Reflection

Research, Audience Perception, Communication Skills, Technical Skills, Writing, Document Design, Fluency with Digital Tools, User Research and Testing

Where are your strengths in terms of these skills? How did these strengths become evident in your project work? (This would be a good place to make specific references to your project materials.)

I feel that my writing skills are my best feature, and that by combining that with my knowledge of video editting I was truly able to provide a lot to this project. The writing of the text that appears in the video that I had created myself is what I believe truly shows my best skills. My research allowed me to gather the information I needed to provide a good yet quick history/explination of Zines because of my understanding of the audience perception of my fellow college students. 

Where might you need some improvement and continued development? How is this evident in your project work? (Again, this would be a good place to make specific references to your project materials.)

I will admit that my proficiency with Final Cut Pro was not the best, but I was able to make a rather decent video in the time I had. If only I was more familiar with Apple products in general, I suppose. The Document Design of the Zine itself somehow got messed up as well in the process of us making it. This meant we had to reprint the Zine in the correct page order. 

What do you see as being some next steps for you in terms of these skills? Look ahead to the next project -- how might you take that project as an opportunity for growth and development?

The skills I hope to develop further in my future projects would certainly be my communication skills over messaging and my Technical Skills. I feel that while my brief history of the Zine was good, I think that adding the steps of making the Zine not just in the Zine itself, but into the video as well would have been far more helpful to the students looking to rely on our video. For this next project I will try to keep in contact with my project partner, and make our final project more user friendly.

# As for Collaboration


How would describe your collaboration for this project?

The Zine Project's collaboration was not bad by any means, I only wish that we had been able to work outside of class at least once. Missing one day had thrown us off our rythem and by then I had had no time outside of the classroom to be able to work on the project the same time she could. 

What went well or seemed to work? Why?

Using the Google Doc was great, and being able to rent out the video equipment we needed from the library was very convenient, but after missing that one day to edit for the entire class time I was very short on time. And then when I had tried to come into the lab outside of class it was already too late and the door was locked.

Where did the collaboration breakdown? Why do you think this happened?

By not being able to access the video file I fell behind in editting and therefore finishing the project. I would have tried to put the file on another computer, but that would have taken nearly an hour for such a large video file and I didn't have the luxury to be wasting time like that. If I hadn't been unable to attend class that one day, or have had more time outside of class to edit I think I would have been able to finish the project and produced a better final product.

Let's assume that this isn't the last time you'll be asked to collaborate. Given your experience, how will approach your next collaborative situation? What will you be sure to try and do to be successful?

First, I'll try not to get sick again and miss class, but also communicating more frequently outside of class in order to use the class time best. Using a Google Doc again would also probably most convenient.

Given all that you've said above, what grade would you give yourself for this project? How does this grade fit, or seem warranted, given your work the products produced?

Of course I want an A, but with everything that happened I feel that in all honesty the final procduct probably only warrants a B or B+ if you're feeling generous.
